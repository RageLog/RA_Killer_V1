# RA_Killer_V1
First C# project for personal usage

* First of all I'm still C++ devoloper and don't need to elegant solution, speed and don't have enough time for this project.
* Second of all I don't know C#.
* Third of all The code is really spaghetti. I did'nt follow any principle :/
* So when take a reference from this project if I were you, I would think twice about this :)
* And in the last, for above words,  don't judge me please :)
